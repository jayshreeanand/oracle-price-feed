### NCN DeFi Price Oracle

A decentralized, real-time price oracle powered by NCN & Cambrian SDK for secure DeFi applications.

####  Project Description:

The **NCN DeFi Price Oracle** is a decentralized, real-time cryptocurrency price feed that fetches and verifies market prices from Binance’s API. Built on **Cambrian’s Node Consensus Network (NCN)**, it ensures reliable, tamper-resistant price updates for DeFi applications on Solana.

This oracle provides **high-frequency, on-chain price updates** with built-in verification mechanisms to enhance security and reduce manipulation risks. Designed for **DEXs, lending protocols, and automated trading systems**, it enables trustless financial interactions in the Web3 ecosystem.

####  Key Features:

- **Decentralized Price Feeds** – Aggregates prices from Binance & multiple sources for accurate market data.
- **NCN Verification** – Uses **Node Consensus Networks** to validate price integrity before publishing.
- **Real-Time Updates** – Configurable interval for fetching and updating prices on-chain.
- **Multi-Pair Support** – Supports **SOL/USDT, BTC/USDT**, and can be extended to other tokens.
- **Error Handling & Logging** – Built-in safeguards for API failures and network issues.
- **Solana Integration** – Designed to be consumed by DeFi smart contracts for lending, swaps, and derivatives.

#### Use Cases:

- **DEXs & AMMs** – Reliable on-chain prices for swaps & limit orders.
- **Lending Platforms** – Accurate collateral pricing for borrowing/lending decisions.
- **Perpetual & Derivatives Trading** – Real-time feeds for margin trading platforms.
- **Algorithmic Stablecoins** – Trusted price inputs for peg maintenance.

####  Tech Stack:

- **Cambrian SDK (NCN)** – Decentralized consensus for price verification.
- **Binance API / CoinGecko** – Off-chain price sources.
- **FastAPI / Node.js** – Backend for fetching and processing data.

####  Why This Matters?

Current oracles like Chainlink charge high fees, while centralized APIs introduce risks of **manipulation and single points of failure**. This project provides an **affordable, decentralized, and developer-friendly alternative** with verifiable price accuracy through NCN.
